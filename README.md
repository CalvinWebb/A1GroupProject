# Cellular Evolution Simulator
Its basically you have cells that can move based off of a FFNN(Feed Forward Neural Network) and then you would have food that spawns around the map and reproduction. You make it so that the cells have to eat to survive and once they eat enough food they can decide to reproduce. Then you let it run and the NN learns to control the cell it inhabits in order to survive.
